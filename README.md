# Weather Detection Application

## Overview
This is a simple command-line application that fetches and displays current weather information based on user input. The application utilizes the Open-Meteo API to provide real-time weather data without requiring an API key.

## Features
- Fetch current weather information for any city.
- Displays temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, and more.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Requests library

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- `requests` library. Install it using:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
You can clone this repository or create a new Python file named `weather.py` in your local environment.

### 2. Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have the `requests` library installed. If not, run:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### 3. Run the Application
Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python weather.py
```

### 4. Enter a City Name
When prompted, enter the name of a city (e.g., London, New York, Tokyo) to get the current weather information.

## Example Output
```
Enter the city name: London
City: London
Temperature: 15Â°C
Weather Code: 3  # This will correspond to a specific weather condition
Wind Speed: 5.1 m/s
```

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure your internet connection is stable.
- If you encounter SSL errors, make sure your `requests` library is up to date.
- You can temporarily disable SSL verification if necessary, but it's not recommended for production.
